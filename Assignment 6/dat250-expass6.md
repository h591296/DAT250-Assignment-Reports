# Hand-in: short report

## URL-links

Angular: https://github.com/h591296/my-app.git

Spring REST API: https://github.com/h591296/DAT250-Spring-Counters-Todos.git


## Technical problems that I encountered during the completion of the tutorial and pending issues

I had a hard time understanding how to connect the REST API from Assignment 4 into the angular project. I have never worked with angular before, so I spent quite a few hours trying to connect the two. In the end, I managed to get the visuals from the html-file to appear on the http://localhost:4200 page, but whenever I tried to add a todo item, nothing happened. To sum up, I have some overall issues understanding how we are supposed to use Angular.
